I was assigned tasks to work on, for my endpoint I was tasked with the get one endpoint. We discussed which database would work better for us either Mongodb or Postgresql. Took Paul's advice and looked at our endpoints. We should make them look more restful (they should look more like code and how they would look on the site).

Had some blockers mainly on where to get started there feels like there is so much work that needs to be done. What is an issue and how should we write them??

We confirmed our database, decided on using postgres. I think it would work better with our data because I do not think it will change much. Our data is already structured out. I went through our excalidraw and changed our endpoints to look more restful.

I did my first merge request it was straightforward, it makes it so that we will not push broken code to the main file. Like instructor, Josh once said, "Don't put bad code in main. Just don't do it"- Josh Elder

Talked about beekeeper, seems like we don't really need it for the project, its basically like another insomnia but FastApi makes so that you can see your endpoints on chrome if you have an outer built out already.

No blockers

Created a working branch but realized with the process of the merge request they will eventually be deleted. We should title our working branches the feature we are working on like ex. Create a profile.

Finished our dockerfile renamed a couple things so that they represent q-link.

Been working on Issues I kind of get how they work, but Rosheen said that they donâ€™t have to be as detailed as I made mine. I bet I can break up the issues even more then.

We built our first endpoint together; it was the Create a profile endpoint. Kevin explained the code to us in great detail.

We talked about working together today to get our endpoints worked out. We were able to build the remaining endpoint for get all, get one, edit, and delete. I had get one and it was so easier to build than I thought it was. I can go into my weekend feeling accomplished that we finally got some code done. I re-watched the Curtis tutorial videos and it was a cinch to build out. Thanks Curtis!

Remember I know a lot more than I think I do.
