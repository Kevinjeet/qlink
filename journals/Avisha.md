Today, I worked on:

* Learning how to integrate FastApi into our project

I'm finishing up watching the FastApi videos today and it's really interesting to see how everything connects and yes there might be some hiccups along the way but I'm confident that I'm going to get this!

Also my brain is actually clicking on the router and queries part of it!

Today, I worked on:

* Installing the delete user function

I got the delete thing to work! I procrastinated but I finished it and it feels great

FastApi is so much simpler to learn once you start!

Today, we worked on:

* Authentication

We were able to get the sign in and sign up to work for our backend with the help of SEIRS. Curtis auth videos helped a lot.

Tomorrow it'll be more auth stuff.
