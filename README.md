Intended Market
We are targeting the LGBTQ+ community. We notice how this market is untapped and wanted to provide a safe space for them to meet eachother.

Functionality
A user can sign up or sign in if they are already a user.
Once logged in they will be a taken to the list of profiles pages to view potential matches.
In that page they have the ability to type in a search bar that could filter the list of profiles by their prefrences.
Also on that page they can click to match with someone or not.
When someone is in your matches or decline they will no longer see them on the list of profiles.
Also each profile that is listed has a button to view that person's profile.
